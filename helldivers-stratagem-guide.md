Quick and to the point for your ADHD addled brain. If you're new to the game and unsure what to use then pick stuff from the 'great' categories and go wild.
You can (and should!) click on things to jump to their detailed analysis.

## Great on both fronts:

## ▼▼▼ IMPORTANT READ THIS BEFORE YAPPING ▼▼▼
While there are 10,000 different ways to play helldivers and everyone is going to approach it in their own way, I personally believe that the game is most fun when you kill as much stuff as possible. We're here to spread democracy and to quote a guy who's quoting a guy: "just because it works doesn't mean it's good". If you want to maximize your ability to keep your fluids where they should be while spilling as much of the aliens' as possible, then you've come to the right place.

1. **I'm reviewing things for their ability to get kills or facilitate something else to get kills.**
    - Stratagems that are only useful in a playstyle centered around running away won't earn any praise from me.
2. **I'm reviewing things for their performance in a Super Helldive (d10) duo.** *Not solo, not in a full group, not on any other difficulty.*
    - Many stratagems that are viable on lower difficulties can't keep up with d10's tempo.
    - With a smaller party size, there's less room for niche tools that you'll only use thrice per mission.
3. **I'm reviewing things with the assumption that you are willing to use every trick available to maximize their value per slot.**
    - For example: I assume that you share your partner's backpack or that you find a railgun on the map.
4. **I'm reviewing things with the assumption that you see having fewer deaths as a 'higher score'.**
5. **I'm not going to directly tell you what to use. I want you to use your brain and decide for yourself.**
    - I put a ton of effort into my testing and the least you can do is put some effort into thinking critically about the information that I'm presenting you. If you just want to be told what to use then go to reddit or discord, those people are happy to do so.
6. **I'm not going to put things into a simple tierlist.**
    - Tiers cause more problems than they solve; it's well-established that people will ignore descriptions in favor of tiers when provided the chance and I don't want to deal with that nonsense.

# Analysis: Orbitals
Orbitals are supposed to be high cooldown and high impact options. However, in practice their effectiveness per dial struggles to compete with that of other stratagems. It's a reasonable expectation for an Orbital to fail a direct competition with an Eagle or Emplacement equivalent in the same role. Orbital stratagems tend to only stand out when offering something completely unique.


## Orbital Precision Strike ►►▲
> <img src="/images/stratagems/Orbital_Precision_Strike_Stratagem_Icon.webp" title="Orbital Precision Strike" width="64"> <br>
Fires a **single shot** from the Destroyer's 406mm ATLAS cannon. <br>
The projectile deals 450 AP8 damage on a direct hit. Its explosion deals 1000 AP6 damage with a 4m inner radius.

The sole jewel in the Super Destroyer's... uh, paper hat, the Precision Strike is the very first stratagem that's been buffed by Arrowhead to serve the role that players want it to serve rather than the role it was originally intended to serve. Fittingly, it's the only meta Orbital stratagem and sees widespread use in many loadouts on both Bug and Bot fronts.

Its power comes from its ability to quickly put down any large threat in the game as long as they're doing something even vaguely predictable. In addition to its consistent performance and easy phone number, it also comes with a quick cooldown allowing it to keep up with the tempo required from stratagems on the highest difficulties.

Overall an excellent stratagem that just does what it's supposed to do and a frequent keystone of many loadouts.

# Analysis: Eagles
Put simply: the Eagle is an absolute powerhouse. Not only does it have the closest thing to a mandatory stratagem in the Airstrike, but nearly all of its options outcompete their Orbital equivalents while also frequently offering novel utility on top. Over half the options in this category have at least one niche where they wipe the floor with every alternative.

## Eagle Airstrike ▲►▼►
> <img src="/images/stratagems/Eagle_Airstrike_Stratagem_Icon.webp" title="Eagle Airstrike" width="64"> <br>
Drops a spread of **6** 100kg **bombs**, coming in perpendicular to the throw location. <br>
Each bomb deals 500 AP5 damage on a direct hit. Their explosions deal 800 AP5 damage with a 5m inner radius.




# Analysis: Vehicles
Our only vehicles at the moment are exosuits... and these things are not regarded well by the community. Despite being buggy and not behaving as anyone wanted, they can still find use. They're especially effective on loadouts dedicated to high cooldown toss-and-forget style stratagems such as orbital barrages or sentries.


# Analysis: Emplacements
Alongside the Eagle, the emplacement category is the most viable overall. Most emplacements have a niche where they're best in slot for the role and many are competitive in roles outside their niche. Things aren't entirely sunshine and roses though: several emplacements still suffer from severe bugs or frustrating design.


# Analysis: Backpacks
Backpacks might just be the single most misunderstood stratagem type in the entire game. I could write an entire dissertation on this, but I'll keep it simple for you with a couple bullet points:
- When you equip a backpack in your loadout it consumes a slot that you can't spend on an offensive stratagem.
- When an ally takes a backpack stratagem they can share their extra with you, functionally multiplying the slot's value.
- Even when you pick up a backpack from the ground for free, it means you can't use the best support weapon in the game. <br> I'm sure you already know which one that is.
