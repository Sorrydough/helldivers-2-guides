# Sorrydough's opitionated & extra-biased stratagem guide

## ▼▼▼ IMPORTANT READ THIS FIRST ▼▼▼
While there are 10,000 different ways to play helldivers and everyone is going to approach it in their own way, I personally believe that the game is most fun when you kill as much stuff as possible.
We're here to spread democracy after all.
So with that being said:
1. **I'm reviewing things for their ability to get kills or facilitate something else to get kills.**
- If something is only good for running away then I'll mention it to be thorough but the stratagem won't earn any praise from me.
2. **I'm reviewing things for their performance in a Super Helldive (d10) duo.** *Not solo, not in a full group, not on any other difficulty.*
- Many stratagems that are viable on lower difficulties can't keep up with d10's tempo.
- With a smaller party size, there's less room for niche tools that you'll only use once per mission.
3. **I'm reviewing things with the assumption that you are willing to use every trick available to maximize their value per slot.**
- For example: I assume that you share your partner's backpack or that you find a railgun on the map instead of spending a slot on it.
